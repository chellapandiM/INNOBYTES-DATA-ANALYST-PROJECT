## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover trends, product performance, and customer behavior. The analysis is done using Python in **Google Colab** for easy sharing and collaboration. Key insights include the most popular products, the impact of size on sales, the most preferred fulfillment methods, and regional sales distribution.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
- **Google Colab**: For running and sharing the analysis in an interactive notebook environment

## Data Analysis

The dataset includes various fields like:

- Product categories (T-shirts, Blazers, Perfumes, etc.)
- Sales trends over time (monthly sales data)
- Sales by size (Small, Medium, Large, etc.)
- Fulfillment status (Shipped, Unshipped, On the Way)
- Regional and city-based sales distribution

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in product sales, the effectiveness of fulfillment methods, and customer preferences based on geographical location.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations have been created, including:

- **Sales Trend Over Time**: Line plots showing the sales performance across months.
- **Product Category Distribution**: Bar plots and pie charts depicting sales by product category.
- **Geographical Sales Distribution**: Heatmaps and bar charts showing regional sales data.
- **Fulfillment Status Analysis**: Visualizing the effectiveness of different fulfillment methods (Shipped vs Unshipped).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or open the **Google Colab** link.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-sales-trend-analysis.git
